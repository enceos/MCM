Multipurpose Colony Modules

Do you like using the awesome Modular Kolonization System by RoverDude? Love the adorable KSO shuttles? Do you wish the MKS modules would fit inside the Super 25 without clipping through the payload bays and getting stuck, or that there were MKS modules for the KSO 1.8? Is your parts catalog overflowing? Then the Multipurpose Colony Modules may be the answer for you.
