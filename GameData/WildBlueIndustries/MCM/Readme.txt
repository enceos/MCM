Multipurpose Colony Modules

Do you like using the awesome Modular Kolonization System by RoverDude? Love the adorable KSO shuttles? Do you wish the MKS modules would fit inside the Super 25 without clipping through the payload bays and getting stuck, or that there were MKS modules for the KSO 1.8? Is your parts catalog overflowing? Then the Multipurpose Colony Modules may be the answer for you.

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the WildBlueIndustries directory and Firespitter directory into your GameData folder.

---REVISION HISTORY---

0.4.0: 
IMPORTANT NOTE: You'll need USI Kolonization Systems 0.22.6 or higher.
- The colony templates now support a variety of efficiency parts. Thanks RoverDude for making this possible. :)
- Adjusted tech level requirements for the storage templates to reflect when the colony module templates that use them are available in the tech tree.
- The MBM now has stack attachment nodes on all six sides, enabling it to become a station hub.
- Added an alternate mesh configuration to the MBM for orbital operations.
- Deprecated the original MBU part. The old part starts with (OBSOLETE) in its title.
- Added the PackRat Rover Chassis Adapter (PRCA). The PRCA is designed to attach to the MBU and serve as a mounting point for the PackRat Rover's Chassis Rear Section. Now you can use the PackRat rover system by RoverDude to drive your modules around! USI Exploration Pack by RoverDude downloaded separately.
- The IMEM now has efficiency configurations for the Kerbitat (TM), Fabricator, Refinery, Fuel Refinery, Repair Shop, Aeroponics, and Machinery Plant. Workspace and living space has been buffed as a result. The IMEM and IOWA can also become a Training Akademy.
- Deprecated the IMEM_Workspace and IMEM_Livingspace templates.
- The IMEM now has a stack attachment node to make it easy to line up with an MBM's side nodes in the VAB/SPH.
NOTE: Your existing IMEMs will need to be retired before installing this update. Simply deflate them and store them in a KAS container, then retrieve them. That should give you the new functionality.
- The IMW now has a stack attachment node to make it easy to line up with an MBM's side nodes in the VAB/SPH.
- Added a Fusion storage template that holds FusionPellets and Glykerol.
- The Fuel Refinery has new converters for producing FusionPellets and Glykerol.
- Added the Inflatable Orbital Workshop Addition (IOWA), an efficiency part similar to the IMEM but made for orbital stations. It has convenient attachment nodes as well.
- You can now "store" the IMW, IMEM, and IOWA efficiency parts on the MBU's attachment nodes. The part will be stored at the node nearest to the kerbal on EVA (the hatch looking thingies on the side).
- Inflatable modules require confirmation before being deflated to avoid losing resources. Yay for less aggravation!
- Inflatable modules won't deflate if there are kerbals still inside.
- The MSM and MBU may be reconfigured in the field to store different resources.
- The MCM may be reconfigured in the field to become a different colony module after you have unlocked the Composites tech node.
- Made some improvements to the Module Operations Manager (MOM).
- Corrected description and cost for the Skydock 375.
- Added the Homestead Inflatable Multipurpose Module (IMM). Homestead is a large inflatable module that can serve as a colony module or as a large-capacity storage module. The Homestead serves as its own efficiency part.

- Added the Ponderosa Advanced Colony Module (ACM). Ponderosa is the penultimate colony module in Wild Blue Industries' product line. When deflated, it can be carried on the back of a Kerbal on EVA, fits standard KAS container bays, and is easily deployed in the field. Once deployed, it will require Machinery to configure into the desired colony module (this is in addition to the Machinery required by most modules to operate).

--- Optional Components ---

Module Manager patches are provided to enable Multipurpose Colony Modules to be used with 3rd party mods. These mods are not included in the download, but a link is provided.

--- Porkjet's Habitat Pack (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64442-0-23-5-Habitat-Pack-v0-4)
NOTE: Get the Layered Animations mod by Starwasher to fix issues with the Small Centrifuge. Link:https://github.com/Starwaster/LayeredAnimations/releases
- The Small Centrifuge can be used as a Kerbitat (TM) efficiency part (hab ring).
- The PA330 can be used as an inflatable storage container.
- The PA550 can be used as an Aeroponics efficiency part (greenhouse).

--- Known Issues ---
- Adding MSM, MCM, and the Homestead module using symetry and then changing the storage types will cause the right-click menu to break. As a workaround, don't use symmetry.

0.3.0: IMPORTANT NOTE: 0.3.0 is a game-breaking change! Be sure to retire your existing bases/spacecraft before applying this update.
- Recompiled for KSP 0.9.0 Beta.
- Refactored templates for compatibility with USI Kolonization Systems by RoverDude. Reminder: You need to download the USI Kolonization Systems mod separately.
- Added Ore, Metal, and KAS storage templates.
- The Colony Command Center can now act as a survey module for Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL).
- Removed Rocket Workshop MCM-EL template- building RocketParts is handled by the Machinery template.
- Added Skydock 375. The Skydock 375 can support vessels up to 42 meters in diameter.
- Added the Multipurpose Storage Module (MSM), a non-inflatable storage unit available earlier in the tech tree than the Inflatable Multipurpose Warehouse.
- Added the Inflatable Multipurpose Extension Module (IMEM), a KAS-storable and attachable workspace/living space extension (efficency part). Production modules like the Fabrication, Refinery, Fuel Refinery, Repair Shop, and Machinery Plant use this to make stuff.
- Refactored stock tech tree progression of the multipurpose modules (CTT is planned, but is further down the road).

Known Issues
- Using the MBU or MCM as a root part might cause part separation upon loading the spacecraft. This issue is continuing to be investigated. Don't use them as root parts.

0.2.6: Added ability to scrap vessels to the Skydock 250. Thanks for the suggestion, RainDreamer! :)

0.2.5: Fixed a template issue preventing the Equipment storage template from working. Fixed a problem that prevented the Inflatable Multipurpose Warehouse (IMW) from remembering if it was inflated or deflated. Fixed a problem with the IMW that prevented it from remembering its max storage amounts when the scene loads. Fixed an isse where the MCM would not know what templates it had after loading into a scene. Added Rocket Workshop MCM template and RocketParts MBU/IMW templates. Added Skydock 250 part.

0.2: Updated The Foot's art assets. Introduced the Inflatable Multipurpose Warehouse. Fixed a problem with the MBU leaping into the air upon being deployed with legs out from the VAB/SPH- thanks nil2work! :) Fixed efficiency parts on kerbitat and greenhouse templates.

0.1.3: Introduced The Foot, an asteroid grabber designed to attach to the bottom of the MBU. Fixed an issue preventing the science lab from cleaning lab experiments and processing lab data. Added SpareParts resources to modules.

0.1.2: Added surface attach ability to the MBU. Modified Repair Shop template to use correct converter values. Fixed LiquidFuel value for Refueling template. Fixed issue in the SPH that prevented the MCM/MBU from switching types.

0.1.1: Initial revision
