  description = Tired of subsisting on stale snacks and koylent green?  Grow your own food with our newly improved greenhouse - Just add fresh compost, water and sunlight!  Kitchenette not included.  Requires at least one Agriculture Module to operate!  NOTE:  The Air Filter allows the module to operate without CO2, but also removes O2 production (for places like Laythe and Kerbin)
