  description = No more being stuffed into a Lander Can for decades at a time!  Our newly improved Kerbitat(tm) habitation module provides everything a Kerbal needs to survive in comfort and style.  Includes food preparation facilities, hookups for environmental control, and 30% less explosive decompression than our earlier models.  Requires at least one inflatable habitation dome (for MKS) or Habitation Ring (for OKS) to operate.
